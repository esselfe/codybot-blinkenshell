codybot is an IRC bot written in the C programming language,
providing users with fortune cookies, jokes, weather per city,
ascii-art images, text colorization and fortune cookie counter.

The bot can connect to irc.blinkenshell.org or any specific server
using a specified port or 6697 by default for a SSL connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' within the source directory
and run with './codybot -n YourBotNick'. Run './codybot --help'
to see all program options.

There is no installation mechanism, you should use the source directory
or move the files where you want. The files 'data-ascii.txt', 'data-chars.txt',
'data-fortunes.txt', 'data-jokes.txt' and 'stats' must be in the program's
current working directory otherwise the program will not run.

You can identify to NickServ by typing 'id yourpasswordhere' or 
'privmsg NickServ :identify pass' in the terminal running the codybot
program. Another console-only command you need to run is 
'join #channel_name_here'. Note that bots are not welcome or
not permitted in popular/topic-dedicated channels. Please always ask the
permission if you don't own/autocreate (by joining an empty & unregistered)
channel.

To see available commands, send '!help' in the channel where the bot is.

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '!fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot. The fortune cookie database file is 
data-fortunes.txt. It's made of /usr/share/games/fortunes using my
system-provided fortune package. (see https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod)

To get a random joke type '!joke'. This database is hand written using
https://www.funnyshortjokes.com content and is far from containing all
the sites' jokes! There's 25 jokes as of 20200510.

To get weather report from https://wttr.in type '!weather citynamehere'
This should return something like "Montreal: Partly cloudy 23C/73F"

Enjoy!
